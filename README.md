# Climate and environmental impact of the energy transisition

## Introduction

The transisition to 100% renewables is required to reach zero CO2 emissions. But building a 100% renewable energy system also causes emissions, but also requires sufficient minerals.

How could the transition look like?

As a start, I use the CO2 emmissions and the use of copper as indicators.

## Context
As context I choose "The Netherlands" and a 6 MW onshore wind turbine from Vestas.

### 2040 scenario
- offshore wind: 54.1 TWh
- solar: 18.0 TWh
- onshore wind: 12.9 TWh
- biomass: 8.2 TWh 
---
- gas:  40.5 TWh
- oil:   1.7 TWh
- other: 1.4 TWh

90.2 TWh renewable, 43.6 TWh other, 133.8 total, 67.4% renewables

### 2020 reference
- onshore wind 23.25 peta joule  6.46 TWh
- offshore wind 17.95 peta joule 4.99 TWh

### to build
- onshore wind   6.44 TWh 
- offshore wind 49.11 TWh

Required turbines: 293
Turbines per year: 14.6

### Wind turbine
- production per year 22.0 GWh at 8 m/s
- production lifetime 440 GWh
- 5.6 g CO2 per kWh
- 2464 T CO2 emmisions for building and operating one turbine

### Electricity from gas
238.8 g CO2 per kWh for liquid gas imports

### Copper usage

## Carbon budget
380 GT as of 2023
21 GT per year until 2032 8 Billion people on earth in 2023
2.625 T per year budget per person
My footprint 3 T per year
